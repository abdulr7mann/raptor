## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7 phases derived from requirement dependencies, not research's 3-phase suggestion. Research combined too much into single phases, losing verifiable delivery boundaries.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 starts with reporting fixes (no new capabilities needed) to establish clean output before measuring FP elimination.
- [Roadmap]: FIX requirements distributed to the phases that implement the capability fixing them, not grouped into a separate "fixes" phase.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Python version compatibility: jsonschema 4.26.0 requires Python >= 3.10. Verify project minimum before Phase 2.
- Diverse test targets: Only VAmPI available. Need additional API targets to avoid overfitting. Identify during Phase 2-3 execution.
